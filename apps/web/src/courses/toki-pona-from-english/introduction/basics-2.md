# There aren't as many animals as you think...

Because toki pona has a small vocabulary, most of its words span the meanings of
many words in English. For example, __soweli__ is a toki pona word that refers to
any kind of land mammal, whether it be a sheep, a tiger, or a rhino.
There are ways, which you'll learn later, to be more specific in toki pona. But
a lot of the time, there's no need -- either it doesn't really matter, or it's
obvious from context. This will take some getting used to, but it's one of the
most fun things about toki pona!

# It's time to learn some grammar!

A word you haven't seen yet, but which appears in the majority of toki pona sentences,
is __li__. Technically, it is a predicate marker -- but you don't need to know
what that means in order to use it!
The most basic type of sentence in toki pona is __\[subject\] li \[verb\]__. It describes
an action undertaken by the subject at some point in time; __jan li toki__ can mean
_a person talks_, _a person has talked_, _a person will talk_, or even _people talk_.
toki pona doesn't mark time or amount by default; you'll learn how to do that when
needed in later lessons.
So, why haven't you already seen __li__? Because __mi__ and __sina__ are the exceptions
to the rule. When the subject of a sentence is _exactly_ __mi__ or _exactly_ __sina__,
the __li__ is dropped, as in __mi toki__ (_I talk_). Using __li__ in these cases
is grammatically incorrect.
In this skill, you'll get some practice with __li__ and learn more words. Have fun!
