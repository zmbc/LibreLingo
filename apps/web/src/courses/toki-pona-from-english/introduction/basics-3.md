# Description

So, now we know how to say that someone (or something) takes an action. What about
descriptors, like old, young, big, or small? Modifiers in toki pona use __li__,
just like verbs! For example, __ona li pona__ means _they are good_.
As with the other use of __li__, it is dropped in sentences where the
subject is __sina__ or __mi__. Sound familiar? Remember that _thank you_ in toki
pona is __sina pona__ -- literally _you are good_.

# Context is key!

But does it ever get confusing that __li__ has this double function? At times,
yes, it can be ambiguous. Many words in toki pona can be both adjectives and verbs.
For example, __lukin__ means both _to look_ and _eye_. So __ona li lukin__ can
mean either _they look_ or _it's an eye_!
Usually, it is pretty easy to figure out which meaning is intended from context.
Throughout this course, you'll get better and better at using context to
differentiate ambiguous meanings in toki pona.
In this skill, you'll get some practice with describing things and learn some new
adjectives!
