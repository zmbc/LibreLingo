# There aren't as many animals as you think...

Because toki pona has a small vocabulary, most of its words span the meanings of
many words in English. For example, **soweli** is a toki pona word that refers to
any kind of land mammal, whether it be a sheep, a tiger, or a rhino.

There are ways, which you'll learn later, to be more specific in toki pona. But
a lot of the time, there's no need -- either it doesn't really matter, or it's
obvious from context. This will take some getting used to, but it's one of the
most fun things about toki pona!

# It's time to learn some grammar!

A word you haven't seen yet, but which appears in the majority of toki pona sentences,
is **li**. Technically, it is a predicate marker -- but you don't need to know
what that means in order to use it!

The most basic type of sentence in toki pona is **[subject] li [verb]**. It describes
an action undertaken by the subject at some point in time; **jan li toki** can mean
*a person talks*, *a person has talked*, *a person will talk*, or even *people talk*.
toki pona doesn't mark time or amount by default; you'll learn how to do that when
needed in later lessons.

So, why haven't you already seen **li**? Because **mi** and **sina** are the exceptions
to the rule. When the subject of a sentence is *exactly* **mi** or *exactly* **sina**,
the **li** is dropped, as in **mi toki** (*I talk*). Using **li** in these cases
is grammatically incorrect.

In this skill, you'll get some practice with **li** and learn more words. Have fun!
