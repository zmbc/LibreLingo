# Description

So, now we know how to say that someone (or something) takes an action. What about
descriptors, like old, young, big, or small? Modifiers in toki pona use **li**,
just like verbs! For example, **ona li pona** means *they are good*.

As with the other use of **li**, it is dropped in sentences where the
subject is **sina** or **mi**. Sound familiar? Remember that *thank you* in toki
pona is **sina pona** -- literally *you are good*.

# Context is key!

But does it ever get confusing that **li** has this double function? At times,
yes, it can be ambiguous. Many words in toki pona can be both adjectives and verbs.
For example, **lukin** means both *to look* and *eye*. So **ona li lukin** can
mean either *they look* or *it's an eye*!

Usually, it is pretty easy to figure out which meaning is intended from context.
Throughout this course, you'll get better and better at using context to
differentiate ambiguous meanings in toki pona.

In this skill, you'll get some practice with describing things and learn some new
adjectives!
